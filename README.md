# JewelryOptimizer

## Project Background

Gemineye Emporium is a jewelry provider operating in the jewelry market. They expanded from a relatively small-scale jewelry provider to a large-scale jewelry designing and trading company. Although this transition has gone well, it has not gone without some issues that the company board did not see coming. These edge cases were further looked into and a particular one is with the prices of products. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1:** Types of Jewelry presently being sold and the gender of their customers catered for most
- **Category 2:** 
- **Category 3:** 
- **Category 4:** 

The code used for data preparation can be found here [link](https://github.com/Three2Two/jewelryOptimizer/blob/main/notebooks/jewelry_optimizer.ipynb#EDA)
.

Pipelines built for various model creations can be found here [link](https://github.com/Three2Two/jewelryOptimizer/blob/main/notebooks/jewelry_optimizer.ipynb#data_modelling).

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
